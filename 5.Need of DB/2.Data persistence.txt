🧠 Meaning of "Persistence" (in general)
✅ In General English:
        Persistence means:

                            "Continuing to exist or continuing to do something even when it is difficult or after a long time."

                            It's about not giving up or lasting over time.




💻 In Computing / Software:
                            In programming, persistence means:

                                                    "The ability of data to stay available even after the program stops running."

🔁 In simple words:
                            Data that doesn't disappear when the app is closed or the computer restarts.

📦 Example:
            If your blog app stores posts in RAM only:

                            Data is not persistent

                            It vanishes on server restart

                            But if you store the posts in a file or database:

                            Data is persistent

                            It stays saved even after a restart




🔡 Telugu Meaning:
                Persistence (general meaning):
                    🔸 స్థిరత్వం (Stiratvam)
                    🔸 దృఢ సంకల్పం (Drudha Sankalpam – for human behavior)


Persistence (in computing context):
                                    🔸 స్థిరమైన డేటా నిల్వ
                                    (Sthiramaina Data Nilva – meaning "data that stays safely stored")





🧪 Without Persistence:

        let names = ["Ravi"];

        names.push("Raju");

// Restart program: names = ["Ravi"] again
  
→ "Raju" is lost after restart because it was only in memory.



💾 With Persistence (Example with File):

        let names = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync("names.json"));

        names.push("Raju");

        fs.writeFileSync("names.json", JSON.stringify(names));

        → Now even after restarting, "Raju" is still saved in names.json

                        Writing on a whiteboard	            ❌ No	                          Erased when wiped (like RAM)
                        
                        Saving in a notebook	            ✅ Yes	                          Stays even after class ends (like database/file)
