what is this "In-memory" array, what is the main purpose of it , why it is called as in memory array , when  i created  a new post , why the new post is not appended in the array , if it is not appended into the array then how come the browers renders the new post , where does the info of new post is stored and rendred , when do delete the existing post of the 3 posts , why does the post is not deleted from the array ?

🧠 What is an In-Memory Array?
    👉 Definition:
            An in-memory array means the data (in this case, blog posts) is stored directly inside the RAM (memory) of the server, not in a permanent database like MySQL, MongoDB, or a file system.

🔍 In your code (solution.js):    
    let posts = [ { id: 1, title: "...", content: "...", ... }, ... ];

    This posts array exists only while the server is running.

    It is reset every time the server restarts.



❓ Why is it called "in-memory"?
            Because the data lives temporarily in memory (RAM) of the computer running the server.

            Just like variables in a JavaScript program, once the process ends or the file is restarted, the memory is cleared and all data is lost.



🧪 Example Scenarios (with answers to your doubts):
🔹 1. "When I create a new post, why is it not added to the array?"

        It is added to the array—but only in the solution.js server’s memory (the backend API running on port 4000).

            Here’s how it works:

            The form on /new submits a POST request.

            That request is received in server.js and forwarded to solution.js (POST /posts).

            solution.js handles the request and does this:

           
            posts.push(post); // new post is added to the array here
            ✅ So yes, the post is added, and then:

            server.js redirects to /

            On home page load, it fetches the updated posts from the API again

            So the browser shows the new post



🔹 2. "Where is the post actually stored?"
            ➡️ Only in RAM of the server where solution.js runs.
            
            There is no database, no file—just a variable in code:
          
            let posts = [...];
            
            So when you refresh the browser, the frontend (server.js) asks the backend (solution.js) for the current posts, and it sends back the array stored in memory.




🔹 3. "When I delete a post, why is it not deleted from the array?"
    It is deleted from the array in memory using this code:

                posts.splice(index, 1);
                
                ✅ This works correctly as long as the server is still running.

                But if you:

                Restart the solution.js server,

                The array will reset to the original 3 posts from the file.

                Because the data is not saved anywhere permanently.




🔹 4. "How come the browser still shows the new post if not saved permanently?"
            Because the new post is in memory, and the browser fetches it from the API (GET /posts) every time you visit /.

            But if you stop and restart the solution.js server:

            The posts array is reset to the original 3 items hardcoded in the file

            So the new post disappears (because it was never saved in a database)



⚠️ Key Limitation of In-Memory Storage
        ✅ Good For	                    ❌ Bad For
        Testing or small demos	        Production apps

        Fast read/write operations	    Data persistence

        Simpler development	            Multi-user environments



✅ Summary
🔍 Question	                                        ✅ Answer
What is in-memory array?	                Temporary array stored in RAM

Why is it called "in-memory"?	            It lives in memory, not disk

Is new post added to array?	                Yes, in API server's memory

Why does new post appear in browser?	    Because server fetches from updated memory

Why post disappears on restart?	            Because array resets to original hardcoded values

Why deleted post reappears after restart?	Same reason: array resets on server restart





🛠️ How to make it persistent?
You need to replace the in-memory array with a database like:

                MongoDB

                PostgreSQL

                SQLite

                Or even writing to a file (JSON or .txt) temporarily




























Q.is memory is allocated when ever a program runs?

Yes, ✅ memory is allocated every time a program runs.



🧠 What is "Memory Allocation"?
        Memory allocation means reserving space in RAM (Random Access Memory) for your program to:

                    Store variables

                    Run functions

                    Keep track of data (arrays, objects, etc.)

                    Hold the call stack and other internals



🔄 When Does Memory Get Allocated?
                    ✅ Every time a program runs, the system gives it some memory from the system's RAM.
                    This happens in steps:

                        Code is loaded into memory


    Memory is given for:

            Code execution (CPU instructions)

            Variables (like arrays, objects, strings, numbers)

            Temporary processing (function calls, loops, etc.)



🧪 Example: Your Node.js Blog App

❤️❤️When you run:

    node solution.js

Then:
    The Node.js runtime loads the file into memory



It creates a memory space for:

        The posts array

        The lastId variable

        Functions like .get(), .post(), etc.

        All this exists in RAM — and stays there only until the program stops

        As soon as you press Ctrl + C or restart the server:

        🧹 All memory is freed

        The next time you start the program, memory is allocated again—but only for the original hardcoded data (not your added posts)






💡 Two Types of Memory Allocation
Type	                        Description	                            Example
Static	                    Fixed-size memory at program start	        let x = 10;

Dynamic	                    Memory given at runtime as needed	        let arr = []; arr.push(...)

JavaScript and Node.js mostly use dynamic memory for variables and objects.



🔚 Summary

✅ Yes, memory is allocated automatically by the system each time your program runs.

❌ It does not persist between runs unless you save data to file or database.
















"So whenever the server starts (or runs), the system allocates memory (RAM) for it.
The posts array is created in that RAM space.
When a new post is created, it is appended to that array in RAM — not saved permanently to disk or database."




🔍 Key Points You Got Right:
        ✅ A new memory space is allocated for the server process when it runs
        ✅ The array (posts) lives in RAM, not on disk
        ✅ New posts get added to that array in memory



🧠 Extra Clarity:
                    RAM is not recreated, but new space in RAM is allocated for each program run

                    The array is lost when the server stops, because it's never written to a file or database

                    That’s why you lose data on restart — RAM is temporary



🧪 Example Analogy:
                    Think of RAM like a whiteboard:

                    When the server runs, it starts with some initial data (written on the whiteboard)

                    You can add more (new posts)

                    But if the server stops — the whiteboard is erased (RAM is wiped)

                    To keep the data, you’d need to write it to a notebook (disk/database) instead.
