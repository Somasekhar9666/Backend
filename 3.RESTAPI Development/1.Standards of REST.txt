Q.What makes an API RESTful?


1. USes Standarded HTTP methods 
     GET 

     POST

     PUT

     PATCH

     DELETE

2.It should have a Standard Data format when it responds
 
            JSON - output

3.client - Server

  client and server are should be completly seperate. they should not be on same system or in the same file , and they are able to message each other over a network.

  In order to make requests and also to get back responses.

  so this kind of architecture allows each side to be able to scale Independtly from each other, So scalling becomes easy.



4.stateless 

 Each Request from the Client to the Server should contain all the information that needed to understand and processes the request.

 So the Server shouldn't be storing any sort of client side state or client side data between requests.

  whiich means that each single request can be completed and each single response is also completed without need to know what happend previously. 

  so again this allows better scalliing of that API and simple server side implementation.


5.Resource -Based

 this kind of API is centered around Resources , also uses a Unique Resource Identifier also known as Resource locator(URI/URL)
