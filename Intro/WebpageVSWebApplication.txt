ðŸ§  Definition of Software
            Software is a set of instructions, data, or programs used to operate computers and perform specific tasks.

In simple words:
            Software tells the computer what to do.
            
            Itâ€™s the opposite of hardware, which is the physical machine.




ðŸ”§ Analogy: Software vs Hardware
            Think of a computer like a human body:

                    Concept	Analogy	What it Does
                                
                                Hardware	Body (hands, eyes, etc.)	Physical parts of the computer
                                
                                Software	Brain/thoughts/instructions	Tells the hardware what to do

                    
                    *Without software, hardware is useless â€” like a robot with no brain.



ðŸ§© Types of Software

1.System Software

        Helps the computer run

        Examples:

            Operating Systems (Windows, Linux, macOS)

            Device Drivers

            Utilities (Disk Cleanup, Antivirus)



2.Application Software

        Helps users perform tasks

        Examples:

                Microsoft Word (writing)

                Photoshop (editing)

                Chrome (browsing)



3.Programming Software

        Used by developers to write other software

        Examples:

                Visual Studio Code

                Compilers (GCC, javac)

                Debuggers




4.Middleware

            Connects different software systems together

            Often used in enterprise systems (like banks, cloud apps)











2. What is an "Application" in Software?
Definition:
            A software application (or just app) is a program or group of programs designed to perform specific tasks for a user.

    It is called an "application" because it applies "computing power" to perform a task or solve a problem for the user.



Why It's Called an Application
            Itâ€™s called an application because itâ€™s a tool applied by the user to do something specific â€” just like a screwdriver is applied to turn screws, an app is applied to complete tasks.



ðŸ§  In Simple Terms:
            A tool you use to do something specific on a computer or phone = Application

            It's called that because you are "applying" the software to solve a problem





The difference between a web page and a web application mainly comes down to complexity, interactivity, and functionality.

âœ… Web Page:
        Definition: A single document or screen that is part of a website, typically displaying static content.

        Purpose: Mostly for information display (e.g., news, articles, about us pages).

        Interactivity: Very limited; users mostly read content.

        Examples:

                    A blog post

                    A contact page

                    A product detail page



âœ… Web Application:

        Definition: A software program that runs in a web browser and allows user interaction and data processing.

        Purpose: To perform tasks, process data, and provide services to users.

        Interactivity: High; users can input data, get dynamic responses, etc.

        Examples:

                    Gmail

                    Facebook

                    Online banking systems

                    Google Docs
